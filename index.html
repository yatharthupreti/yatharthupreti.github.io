    <h1>Networking Notes Downloads</h1>

    <p>Hello there, everyone :)</p>
    <p>I'm Yatharth, your instructor for Networking, Basic Linux and Introduction to Cybersecurity for the next few months. Pleased to meet you all. </p>
    <p>As promised, this website is where I'll upload lecture notes, extra resources and other stuff regarding the material we shall cover, over the coming months. </p>
    <p>For now, you can download the PDF or the Markdown version of the notes for the topics we discussed in class, day-wise.</p>
    
    <p><b>What are Markdown Files?</b> </p>
    <p>Markdown Files are a commonly used file type, which works with Notepad, Note taking apps like <b>Obsidian</b> or any other text editor.</p>
    <p>The biggest advantage is that you can edit the Markdown Files, meaning you can edit the notes, and play with them according to your needs. </p>
    <p><em>I'll take a session on working with Markdown Files early on in January 2025.</em></p>
    <p> Until then, here are the PDFs :)</p>

    <p> <b>PS:</b> Please forgive the ugly looking website, I'll update it and make it better looking soon :) </p>
